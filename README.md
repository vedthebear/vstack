# vstackv2

vstackv2 is a lean personal toolkit for AI coding. The goal is no longer "model a whole virtual engineering org." The goal is to keep the parts that actually compound: a fast persistent browser, a small set of high-leverage skills, and a setup you can install once and reuse across future agent sessions.

The browser runtime remains the strongest part of the system and stays the stable base. Around it, v2 narrows the public skill surface, keeps a small transition layer for old muscle memory, and leaves broader historical workflows in a legacy tier instead of presenting them as the default product.

Core surface:
- `/browse`
- `/office-hours`
- `/investigate`
- `/review`
- `/qa`
- `/ship`
- `/guard`
- `/connect-chrome`
- `/vstack-upgrade`

Transition skills still supported by default:
- `/plan-ceo-review`
- `/plan-eng-review`
- `/qa-only`
- `/careful`
- `/freeze`
- `/unfreeze`
- `/codex`

Legacy skills remain in-repo but are not part of the default v2 install. See [docs/VSTACKV2.md](docs/VSTACKV2.md).

## Quick start

1. Install vstackv2
2. Run `/office-hours` — describe what you're building
3. Run `/investigate` while building or debugging
4. Run `/review` on any branch with changes
5. Run `/qa` on your app or staging URL
6. Stop there. You'll know if this is for you.

## Install — 30 seconds

**Requirements:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Windows only)

### Step 1: Install on your machine

Open Claude Code and paste this. Claude does the rest.

> Install vstackv2: run **`git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack && cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup`** then add a "vstack" section to CLAUDE.md that says to use the /browse skill from vstack for web browsing, never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools, and lists the core skills `/browse`, `/office-hours`, `/investigate`, `/review`, `/qa`, `/ship`, `/guard`, `/connect-chrome`, `/vstack-upgrade`. Mention that transition skills `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/qa-only`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/unfreeze`, and `/codex` still exist. Ask whether they also want the broader legacy surface via `./setup --legacy`.

### Step 2: Add to your repo so teammates get it (optional)

> Add vstackv2 to this project: run **`cp -Rf ~/.claude/skills/gstack .claude/skills/gstack && rm -rf .claude/skills/gstack/.git && cd .claude/skills/gstack && ./setup`** then add a "vstack" section to this project's CLAUDE.md with the same core and transition skill list above. If you want the old broad surface in that repo too, run `./setup --legacy`.

Real files get committed to your repo (not a submodule), so `git clone` just works. Everything lives inside `.claude/`. Nothing touches your PATH or runs in the background.

> **Contributing or need full history?** The commands above use `--depth 1` for a fast install. If you plan to contribute or need full git history, do a full clone instead:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
> ```

### Codex, Gemini CLI, or Cursor

gstack works on any agent that supports the [SKILL.md standard](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code). Skills live in `.agents/skills/` and are discovered automatically.

Install to one repo:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git .agents/skills/gstack
cd .agents/skills/gstack && ./setup --host codex
```

When setup runs from `.agents/skills/gstack`, it installs the generated Codex skills next to it in the same repo and does not write to `~/.codex/skills`.

Install once for your user account:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/gstack
cd ~/gstack && ./setup --host codex
```

`setup --host codex` creates the runtime root at `~/.codex/skills/gstack` and
links the generated Codex skills at the top level. This avoids duplicate skill
discovery from the source repo checkout.

Or let setup auto-detect which agents you have installed:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/gstack
cd ~/gstack && ./setup --host auto
```

For Codex-compatible hosts, setup supports both repo-local installs from `.agents/skills/gstack` and user-global installs from `~/.codex/skills/gstack`. The default install now favors the v2 core surface plus a small transition layer. Use `./setup --legacy` if you explicitly want the broader historical skill set.

## See it work

```
You:    I want to build a daily briefing app for my calendar.
You:    /office-hours
Claude: [asks about the pain — specific examples, not hypotheticals]

You:    Multiple Google calendars, events with stale info, wrong locations.
        Prep takes forever and the results aren't good enough...

Claude: I'm going to push back on the framing. You said "daily briefing
        app." But what you actually described is a personal chief of
        staff AI.
        [extracts 5 capabilities you didn't realize you were describing]
        [challenges 4 premises — you agree, disagree, or adjust]
        [generates 3 implementation approaches with effort estimates]
        RECOMMENDATION: Ship the narrowest wedge tomorrow, learn from
        real usage. The full vision is a 3-month project — start with
        the daily briefing that actually works.
        [writes design doc → feeds into downstream skills automatically]

You:    /plan-ceo-review
        [reads the design doc, challenges scope, runs 10-section review]

You:    /plan-eng-review
        [ASCII diagrams for data flow, state machines, error paths]
        [test matrix, failure modes, security concerns]

You:    Approve plan. Exit plan mode.
        [writes 2,400 lines across 11 files. ~8 minutes.]

You:    /review
        [AUTO-FIXED] 2 issues. [ASK] Race condition → you approve fix.

You:    /qa https://staging.myapp.com
        [opens real browser, clicks through flows, finds and fixes a bug]

You:    /ship
        Tests: 42 → 51 (+9 new). PR: github.com/you/app/pull/42
```

You said "daily briefing app." The agent said "you're building a chief of staff AI" — because it listened to your pain, not your feature request. Eight commands, end to end. That is not a copilot. That is a team.

## The sprint

gstack is a process, not a collection of tools. The skills run in the order a sprint runs:

**Think → Plan → Build → Review → Test → Ship → Reflect**

vstackv2 no longer assumes that every project needs a full internal org chart of agent roles. The default shape is smaller: one strong browser runtime plus a few skills you are likely to invoke repeatedly.

### Core skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/browse` | Persistent browser for testing, screenshots, evidence capture, and dogfooding. |
| `/office-hours` | Shape an idea before coding and pressure-test the first wedge. |
| `/investigate` | Root-cause debugging and implementation troubleshooting. |
| `/review` | Diff-focused review before landing code. |
| `/qa` | Browser-driven test and fix loop. |
| `/ship` | Ship workflow for tests, review, and release hygiene. |
| `/guard` | Combined destructive-command and edit-boundary safety mode. |
| `/connect-chrome` | Launch visible Chrome with the vstack side panel. |
| `/vstack-upgrade` | Upgrade the toolkit. |

### Transition skills

Still installed by default for muscle memory and compatibility, but no longer the main public surface:

- `/plan-ceo-review`
- `/plan-eng-review`
- `/qa-only`
- `/careful`
- `/freeze`
- `/unfreeze`
- `/codex`

### Legacy skills

Retained in-repo, but opt-in via `./setup --legacy`:

- `/autoplan`
- `/benchmark`
- `/canary`
- `/cso`
- `/design-consultation`
- `/design-review`
- `/document-release`
- `/land-and-deploy`
- `/plan-design-review`
- `/retro`
- `/setup-browser-cookies`
- `/setup-deploy`

## Parallel sprints

gstack works well with one sprint. It gets interesting with ten running at once.

**Design is at the heart.** `/design-consultation` doesn't just pick fonts. It researches what's out there in your space, proposes safe choices AND creative risks, generates realistic mockups of your actual product, and writes `DESIGN.md` — and then `/design-review` and `/plan-eng-review` read what you chose. Design decisions flow through the whole system.

**`/qa` was a massive unlock.** It let me go from 6 to 12 parallel workers. Claude Code saying *"I SEE THE ISSUE"* and then actually fixing it, generating a regression test, and verifying the fix — that changed how I work. The agent has eyes now.

**Smart review routing.** Just like at a well-run startup: CEO doesn't have to look at infra bug fixes, design review isn't needed for backend changes. gstack tracks what reviews are run, figures out what's appropriate, and just does the smart thing. The Review Readiness Dashboard tells you where you stand before you ship.

**Test everything.** `/ship` bootstraps test frameworks from scratch if your project doesn't have one. Every `/ship` run produces a coverage audit. Every `/qa` bug fix generates a regression test. 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe instead of yolo coding.

**`/document-release` is the engineer you never had.** It reads every doc file in your project, cross-references the diff, and updates everything that drifted. README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md, TODOS — all kept current automatically. And now `/ship` auto-invokes it — docs stay current without an extra command.

**Real browser mode.** `$B connect` launches your actual Chrome as a headed window controlled by Playwright. You watch Claude click, fill, and navigate in real time — same window, same screen. A subtle green shimmer at the top edge tells you which Chrome window gstack controls. All existing browse commands work unchanged. `$B disconnect` returns to headless. A Chrome extension Side Panel shows a live activity feed of every command and a chat sidebar where you can direct Claude. This is co-presence — Claude isn't remote-controlling a hidden browser, it's sitting next to you in the same cockpit.

**Sidebar agent — your AI browser assistant.** Type natural language instructions in the Chrome side panel and a child Claude instance executes them. "Navigate to the settings page and screenshot it." "Fill out this form with test data." "Go through every item in this list and extract the prices." Each task gets up to 5 minutes. The sidebar agent runs in an isolated session, so it won't interfere with your main Claude Code window. It's like having a second pair of hands in the browser.

**Personal automation.** The sidebar agent isn't just for dev workflows. Example: "Browse my kid's school parent portal and add all the other parents' names, phone numbers, and photos to my Google Contacts." Two ways to get authenticated: (1) log in once in the headed browser — your session persists, or (2) run `/setup-browser-cookies` to import cookies from your real Chrome. Once authenticated, Claude navigates the directory, extracts the data, and creates the contacts.

**Browser handoff when the AI gets stuck.** Hit a CAPTCHA, auth wall, or MFA prompt? `$B handoff` opens a visible Chrome at the exact same page with all your cookies and tabs intact. Solve the problem, tell Claude you're done, `$B resume` picks up right where it left off. The agent even suggests it automatically after 3 consecutive failures.

**Multi-AI second opinion.** `/codex` gets an independent review from OpenAI's Codex CLI — a completely different AI looking at the same diff. Three modes: code review with a pass/fail gate, adversarial challenge that actively tries to break your code, and open consultation with session continuity. When both `/review` (Claude) and `/codex` (OpenAI) have reviewed the same branch, you get a cross-model analysis showing which findings overlap and which are unique to each.

**Safety guardrails on demand.** Say "be careful" and `/careful` warns before any destructive command — rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, git reset --hard. `/freeze` locks edits to one directory while debugging so Claude can't accidentally "fix" unrelated code. `/guard` activates both. `/investigate` auto-freezes to the module being investigated.

**Proactive skill suggestions.** gstack notices what stage you're in — brainstorming, reviewing, debugging, testing — and suggests the right skill. Don't like it? Say "stop suggesting" and it remembers across sessions.

## 10-15 parallel sprints

gstack is powerful with one sprint. It is transformative with ten running at once.

[Conductor](https://conductor.build) runs multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel — each in its own isolated workspace. One session running `/office-hours` on a new idea, another doing `/review` on a PR, a third implementing a feature, a fourth running `/qa` on staging, and six more on other branches. All at the same time. I regularly run 10-15 parallel sprints — that's the practical max right now.

The sprint structure is what makes parallelism work. Without a process, ten agents is ten sources of chaos. With a process — think, plan, build, review, test, ship — each agent knows exactly what to do and when to stop. You manage them the way a CEO manages a team: check in on the decisions that matter, let the rest run.

## Privacy & Telemetry

gstack includes **opt-in** usage telemetry to help improve the project. Here's exactly what happens:

- **Default is off.** Nothing is sent anywhere unless you explicitly say yes.
- **On first run,** gstack asks if you want to share anonymous usage data. You can say no.
- **What's sent (if you opt in):** skill name, duration, success/fail, gstack version, OS. That's it.
- **What's never sent:** code, file paths, repo names, branch names, prompts, or any user-generated content.
- **Change anytime:** `gstack-config set telemetry off` disables everything instantly.

Data is stored in [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (open source Firebase alternative). The schema is in [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/) — you can verify exactly what's collected. The Supabase publishable key in the repo is a public key (like a Firebase API key) — row-level security policies deny all direct access. Telemetry flows through validated edge functions that enforce schema checks, event type allowlists, and field length limits.

**Local analytics are always available.** Run `gstack-analytics` to see your personal usage dashboard from the local JSONL file — no remote data needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not showing up?** `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup`

**`/browse` fails?** `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && bun install && bun run build`

**Stale install?** Run `/gstack-upgrade` — or set `auto_upgrade: true` in `~/.gstack/config.yaml`

**Want shorter commands?** `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --no-prefix` — switches from `/gstack-qa` to `/qa`. Your choice is remembered for future upgrades.

**Want namespaced commands?** `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --prefix` — switches from `/qa` to `/gstack-qa`. Useful if you run other skill packs alongside gstack.

**Codex says "Skipped loading skill(s) due to invalid SKILL.md"?** Your Codex skill descriptions are stale. Fix: `cd ~/.codex/skills/gstack && git pull && ./setup --host codex` — or for repo-local installs: `cd "$(readlink -f .agents/skills/gstack)" && git pull && ./setup --host codex`

**Windows users:** gstack works on Windows 11 via Git Bash or WSL. Node.js is required in addition to Bun — Bun has a known bug with Playwright's pipe transport on Windows ([bun#4253](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/4253)). The browse server automatically falls back to Node.js. Make sure both `bun` and `node` are on your PATH.

**Claude says it can't see the skills?** Make sure your project's `CLAUDE.md` has a gstack section. Add this:

```
## gstack
Use /browse from gstack for all web browsing. Never use mcp__claude-in-chrome__* tools.
Available skills: /office-hours, /plan-ceo-review, /plan-eng-review, /plan-design-review,
/design-consultation, /review, /ship, /land-and-deploy, /canary, /benchmark, /browse,
/qa, /qa-only, /design-review, /setup-browser-cookies, /setup-deploy, /retro,
/investigate, /document-release, /codex, /cso, /autoplan, /careful, /freeze, /guard,
/unfreeze, /gstack-upgrade.
```
